# canbus

This is a project to make a real time CAN packet monitoring system using Arduino Nano and MCP2515 modules with the shield you see below. This makes a very affordable and reliable CAN packet monitor and injector. With this data packages we can write the temperature value on the MediNav screen. Unfortunately there is no temp gauge on this Renault models (:

the final version currently running


There is no capasitors in board because the starting ripple voltage is damaging them. So I replaced it with 7812 regulator. Final design will be uploaded.
